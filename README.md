# About this Game:
This is a 2 player split screen pixel platformer.
The goal of every level is to reach the pressure plate corresponding to the player.
When both pressure plates are touched by the respective player, the level is considered passed.
For certain levels there are different paths that the players have to take in order to reach their pressure plates, all while trying to collect as many coins as possible.
